The Guess Age API is a simple API that takes a name as input and predicts the age of a person with that name. It uses the Agify API to fetch the age prediction based on the name.

<h3>How to Run the Project</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
* Docker
* Docker Compose


Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/guess-age-api.git
Change to the project directory:

Build the Docker image and start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

Additional Steps for Production
Security: Ensure that sensitive information such as database passwords and API keys are stored securely and not hard-coded in the source code. Use environment variables or a secret management system.

Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring solutions to track application behavior and performance. This can include error tracking, performance monitoring, and logging of important events.

Backup and Recovery: Set up regular backups of your database and application data to prevent data loss. Have a disaster recovery plan in place to restore services in case of failure.

Scalability: Design your application to be scalable. Consider using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing and scaling your application in production.

Load Testing: Perform load testing to ensure that your application can handle the expected amount of traffic and users. This can help identify bottlenecks and performance issues before they affect users.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment of your application. This can help reduce the time and effort required to release new features and updates.

Security Audits: Regularly conduct security audits of your application and dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Documentation: Maintain up-to-date documentation for your project, including installation and usage instructions, architecture diagrams, and API documentation.

User Feedback and Monitoring: Collect user feedback and monitor user behavior to identify areas for improvement and prioritize feature development.

Compliance: Ensure that your application complies with relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, depending on your industry and location.

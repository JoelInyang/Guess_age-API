<h1 align="center">Guess Age API</h1>

The Guess Age API is a simple API that takes a name as input and predicts the age of a person with that name. It uses the Agify API to fetch the age prediction based on the name.

<h3>How to Run the Project</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
* Docker
* Docker Compose


<h3>Steps</h3>
<h5>Clone the repository:</h5>

<b>https://github.com/JoelInyang/Guess_age-API</b>

<h4>Change to the project directory:</h4>

cd Guess-age-API

<b>Build the Docker image and start the containers:</b>

docker-compose up --build


<b>Access the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000</b>

<h3>Additional Steps for Production</h3>

<h4>Security</h4> : I will ensure that sensitive information such as database passwords and API keys are stored securely and not hard-coded in the source code. Use environment variables or a secret management system.

<h4>Monitoring</h4> : I will ensure implement logging and monitoring solutions to track application behavior and performance. This can include error tracking, performance monitoring, and logging of important events.

<h4>Backup and Recovery</h4> : I will set up regular backups of the database and application data to prevent data loss. Have a disaster recovery plan in place to restore services in case of failure.

<h4>Scalability</h4> : I will design the application to be scalable. Consider using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing and scaling the application in production.

<h4>Load Testing</h4> : Perform load testing to ensure that the application can handle the expected amount of traffic and users. This can help identify bottlenecks and performance issues before they affect users.

<h4>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)</h4> : I will implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the application. This can help reduce the time and effort required to release new features and updates.

<h4>Security Audits</h4> : Regularly conduct security audits of the application and dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

<h4>Documentation</h4> : Maintain up-to-date documentation for the project, including installation and usage instructions, architecture diagrams, and API documentation.

<h4>User Feedback and Monitoring</h4> : Collect user feedback and monitor user behavior to identify areas for improvement and prioritize feature development.

<h4>Compliance</h4> : Ensure that your application complies with relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, depending on the industry and location.
